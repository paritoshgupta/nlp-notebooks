    - Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims at automating the design of Machine Learning solutions.
    - In particular, it encompasses a series of techniques to automatically determine the best ensemble of data preparation, model, and hyperparameters.
    - In the contest of neural networks, AutoML searches among different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to find the best fit, in a process called Neural Architecture Search¹ (NAS).
    - AutoKeras² is an open-source library that implements³ AutoML for deep learning using the Keras API.
    - Use AutoKeras to train a text classifier able to detect spam messages in few lines of code.
